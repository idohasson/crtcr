# crtcr: Convergent Recombination of TCR Repertoire

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

A commonly used method for quantifying the degree of similarity of TCR repertoires is the concept of convergent recombination of T-cell receptors (TCRs).

This R package implements this method and includes key functions that are involved throughout the execution of such analyses.

On the basis of these supplied measurements calculations, it is possible to identify identical clonotypes that resulted from a range of clonal sequences, which may then be used for an analysis method that corresponds with a particular immunological state.

## Installation

You can install the released version of crtcr from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("crtcr")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("idohasson/crtcr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(crtcr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
