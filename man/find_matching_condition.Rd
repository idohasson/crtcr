\title{Find Matching Condition}
\usage{
find_matching_condition(
  vectors,
  threshold_levels = 1,
  conditions = c(">", ">=", "==", "<=", "<")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vectors}{a list of numeric vectors}

\item{threshold_levels}{a vector of threshold levels for the condition (one is needed for every vector)}

\item{conditions}{a vector of conditions to apply to the numeric vectors (one is needed for every vector)}
}
\value{
a vector of matching threshold levels
}
\description{
This function finds the highest threshold level that satisfies a given condition for a list of numeric vectors. The threshold level and condition can be provided as arguments, or they can be generated from the data. The conditions are applied in the following order: >, >=, ==, <=, <.
}
\examples{
# Create a list of numeric vectors
vectors <- list(c(1, 2, 3, 4), c(5, 6, 7, 8), c(9, 10, 11, 12))

# Find the highest threshold level that satisfies the condition for each vector
find_matching_condition(vectors, threshold_levels = c(2, 3, 4), conditions = c(">", ">=", "=="))

# Generate threshold levels and conditions from the data
find_matching_condition(vectors)
